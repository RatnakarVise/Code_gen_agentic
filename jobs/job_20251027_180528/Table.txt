### 2) Purpose Section

**Purpose of ZPO_CLOSE_LOG Table:**

The `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table is designed to store detailed logs related to the closure of Purchase Orders (POs) within the SAP system. This table captures essential information about the closure process, including the user who executed the closure, the date and time of the closure, the status of the closure, and any relevant messages that may provide additional context or information regarding the closure action.

**Key Relationships:**

- **EKKO (Purchasing Document Header):** The `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table is related to the `EKKO` table through the `EBELN` field, which represents the Purchase Order Number. This relationship allows for tracking the closure of specific purchase orders and linking closure logs back to the corresponding purchase order header.

- **EKPO (Purchasing Document Item):** The `EBELP` field in the `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table relates to the `EKPO` table, which contains item-level details for each purchase order. This relationship enables the logging of closure actions at the item level, providing a granular view of which items within a purchase order have been closed.

Overall, the `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table serves as a critical component for auditing and tracking the closure of purchase orders, ensuring that all closure actions are recorded and can be referenced for future analysis or reporting.
