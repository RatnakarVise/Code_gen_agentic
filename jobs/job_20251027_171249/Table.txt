### 2) Purpose Section

**Purpose:**
The `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table is designed to log the details of the closure operations performed on purchasing documents (POs) within the SAP system. This table captures essential information about each closure event, including the purchase order number, item number, user who executed the closure, date and time of the closure, closure status, and any relevant status messages. 

**Key Relationships:**
- **EKKO (Purchasing Document Header)**: The `EBELN` field in `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` relates to the `EBELN` field in the EKKO table, which represents the header of the purchasing document. This relationship allows for tracking which purchase order is being closed.
- **EKPO (Purchasing Document Item)**: The `EBELP` field in `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` corresponds to the `EBELP` field in the EKPO table, which identifies the specific item within the purchase order. This relationship is crucial for understanding which item is affected by the closure.
- **User Information**: The `ERNAM` field captures the user who executed the closure, linking to user management tables in SAP for auditing and accountability purposes.

This table serves as a critical component for monitoring and managing the closure process of purchasing documents, ensuring that all closure activities are recorded and can be reviewed for compliance and operational efficiency.
