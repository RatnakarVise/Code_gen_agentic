### 2) Purpose Section

**Purpose of ZPO_CLOSE_LOG Table:**

The `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table is designed to store detailed logs related to the closure of Purchase Orders (POs) in the SAP system. This table captures essential information about the closure process, including the user who executed the closure, the date and time of the closure, the status of the closure, and any relevant messages that may provide additional context or information regarding the closure action.

**Key Relationships:**

- **EKKO (Purchasing Document Header):** The `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table is closely related to the `EKKO` table, which contains the header information for purchasing documents. The `EBELN` field in `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` serves as a foreign key referencing the `EBELN` field in `EKKO`, linking the closure log to the specific purchasing document.

- **EKPO (Purchasing Document Item):** Similarly, the `EBELP` field in `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` corresponds to the item number in the `EKPO` table, which contains details about the individual items within a purchasing document. This relationship allows for tracking closures at both the document and item levels.

- **User and Date Information:** The `ERNAM`, `ERDAT`, and `ERZET` fields provide information about the user who performed the closure and the exact time of the closure, which is crucial for auditing and tracking purposes.

Overall, the `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table enhances the transparency and traceability of the purchasing process by maintaining a comprehensive log of closure activities, thereby supporting better management and oversight of purchasing operations within the SAP system.
