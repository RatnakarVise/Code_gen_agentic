### 2) Purpose Section

**Purpose:**
The `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table is designed to store logs related to the closure of Purchase Orders (POs) in the SAP system. This table captures essential details about the closure process, including the user who executed the closure, the date and time of the closure, the status of the closure, and any relevant messages that may provide additional context or information regarding the closure action.

**Key Relationships:**
- **EKKO (Purchasing Document Header):** The `EBELN` field in the `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table serves as a foreign key that references the `EBELN` field in the EKKO table, linking the closure log to the specific purchasing document header.
- **EKPO (Purchasing Document Item):** The `EBELP` field in the `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table corresponds to the `EBELP` field in the EKPO table, allowing for the identification of the specific item within the purchase order that has been closed.
- **User Information:** The `ERNAM` field captures the user who performed the closure, which can be cross-referenced with user master data for auditing and accountability purposes.

This table is crucial for tracking the lifecycle of purchase orders, ensuring that all closure actions are logged for compliance and operational transparency. It also aids in troubleshooting and provides a historical record of closure activities.
