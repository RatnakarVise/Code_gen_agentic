### 2) PURPOSE Section

The `ZSTR_PO_CLOSE` structure is designed to facilitate the processing of Purchase Order (PO) closures within the SAP system. It encapsulates all necessary data elements required for managing the closure of purchase orders, including essential identifiers such as the purchase order number, item number, and vendor information. 

The structure includes fields for tracking quantities, such as the order quantity, goods received quantity, and open quantity, which are critical for ensuring accurate closure processing. Additionally, it captures the last change date to maintain a record of when the closure was last modified, and a user selection flag to indicate whether the user has opted to proceed with the closure. 

Finally, the structure provides a message field to convey system feedback or errors that may arise during the closure process. Overall, this structure serves as a comprehensive data model for managing the lifecycle of purchase order closures, ensuring that all relevant information is readily available for processing and reporting.
