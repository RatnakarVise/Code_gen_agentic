### 2) Purpose Section

**Purpose of ZPO_CLOSE_LOG Table:**

The `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table is designed to store logs related to the closure of Purchase Orders (POs) in the SAP system. This table captures essential details about the closure process, including the user who executed the closure, the date and time of the closure, the status of the closure, and any relevant messages that may provide additional context or information regarding the closure action.

**Key Relationships:**

- **EKKO (Purchasing Document Header):** The `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table is related to the `EKKO` table through the `EBELN` field, which represents the Purchase Order Number. This relationship allows for tracking the closure of specific purchase orders and linking closure logs to their respective headers.

- **EKPO (Purchasing Document Item):** The `EBELP` field in the `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table corresponds to the item number in the `EKPO` table. This relationship enables detailed tracking of closures at the item level within a purchase order.

- **User Information:** The `ERNAM` field captures the user who executed the closure, providing accountability and traceability for actions taken within the purchasing process.

- **Closure Status and Messages:** The `STATUS` field indicates whether the closure was successful (S) or failed (F), while the `MESSAGE` field can store any relevant information or error messages that occurred during the closure process.

Overall, the `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table serves as a critical component for auditing and monitoring the closure of purchase orders, ensuring that all actions are logged and can be reviewed as needed.
