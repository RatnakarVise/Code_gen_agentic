### 2) Purpose Section

**Purpose:**
The `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table is designed to store logs related to the closure of Purchase Orders (POs) in the SAP system. This table captures essential details about the closure process, including the user who executed the closure, the date and time of the closure, the status of the closure, and any relevant messages that may provide additional context or information regarding the closure action.

**Key Relationships:**
- **EKKO (Purchasing Document Header):** The `EBELN` field in the `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table serves as a foreign key that links to the `EKKO` table, which contains the header information for purchasing documents. This relationship allows for tracking which specific purchase order has been closed.
  
- **EKPO (Purchasing Document Item):** The `EBELP` field in the `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table corresponds to the item number in the `EKPO` table, which contains details about the individual items within a purchase order. This relationship enables the logging of closure actions at the item level.

The `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table is crucial for auditing and tracking the closure of purchase orders, ensuring that all closure actions are recorded with relevant details for future reference and compliance.
