### 2) PURPOSE Section

The `ZSTR_PO_CLOSE` structure is designed to facilitate the processing of Purchase Order (PO) closures within the SAP system. It encapsulates essential data elements required for managing the closure of purchase orders, including the purchase order number, item details, material information, vendor identification, and quantities related to the order and goods received. 

This structure serves multiple purposes:
- **Data Organization**: It organizes relevant fields into a single structure, making it easier to handle and pass around data related to PO closure processes.
- **User Interaction**: The `flag_close` field allows users to indicate their selection for closure, enabling interactive processing based on user input.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: The `message` field provides a way to communicate system messages back to the user after the closure process, ensuring that users are informed of the outcome of their actions.
- **Audit and Tracking**: The `aedat` field captures the last change date, which is crucial for tracking modifications and maintaining data integrity.

Overall, this structure is integral to the PO closure functionality, ensuring that all necessary data is captured and processed efficiently within the SAP environment.
