### 2) PURPOSE Section

The `ZSTR_PO_CLOSE` structure is designed to facilitate the processing of Purchase Order (PO) closures within the SAP system. It encapsulates essential data elements required for managing the closure of purchase orders, including the purchase order number, item details, material information, vendor identification, and quantities related to the order and goods received. 

This structure serves multiple purposes:
- **Data Organization**: It organizes relevant fields into a single structure, making it easier to handle and pass around data related to PO closure operations.
- **User Interaction**: The `flag_close` field allows users to indicate their selection for closure, enabling interactive processing based on user input.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: The `message` field provides a way to communicate system messages back to the user after the closure process, ensuring that users are informed of the outcome of their actions.
- **Integration**: This structure can be utilized in various ABAP programs, function modules, or reports that require PO closure functionality, promoting reusability and consistency across the application.

Overall, `ZSTR_PO_CLOSE` is a critical component in the workflow of managing purchase orders, ensuring that all necessary information is captured and processed efficiently during the closure phase.
