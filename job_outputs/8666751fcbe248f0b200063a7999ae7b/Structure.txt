**PURPOSE**

The structure `ZSTR_PO_CLOSE` is designed to facilitate the processing and display of purchase order (PO) data in the context of closing open POs in the SAP MM module. Each field in the structure serves a specific purpose:

- **EBELN (Purchase Order Number):** This field holds the unique identifier for each purchase order, allowing the system to track and process individual POs.

- **EBELP (Item Number):** Represents the specific item within a purchase order, enabling item-level processing and closure.

- **MATNR (Material Number):** Stores the material number associated with the PO item, providing clarity on the specific goods or services ordered.

- **LIFNR (Vendor):** Contains the vendor code, identifying the supplier associated with the purchase order.

- **MENGE (Order Quantity):** Reflects the total quantity ordered for the PO item, serving as a reference for calculating open quantities.

- **WEMNG (Goods Received Quantity):** Indicates the quantity of goods received against the PO item, used to determine the remaining open quantity.

- **OPEN_QTY (Open Quantity):** Calculated field representing the difference between the ordered quantity and the received quantity, highlighting the quantity still pending delivery or invoicing.

- **AEDAT (Last Change Date):** Captures the date of the last change made to the PO, useful for identifying POs that have not been updated recently.

- **FLAG_CLOSE (User Selection for Closure):** A flag that allows users to mark specific POs for closure during the report execution.

- **MESSAGE (System Message after closure):** Provides feedback on the closure process, indicating success or failure and any relevant messages.

Overall, this structure serves as a blueprint for internal tables and interfaces between selection logic, processing logic, and ALV output, enabling efficient identification and closure of open POs.
