### 2) PURPOSE Section

**PURPOSE:**

The table `ZMM_PO_CLOSE` is designed to support the custom report `ZMM_PO_CLOSE`, which provides a utility to display and close open purchase orders (POs). The table fields are derived from existing SAP tables such as `EKPO`, `EKKO`, `EKET`, and `LFA1`, and are used to capture essential information about purchase orders. Below is a detailed explanation of each field and its relationship:

- **EBELN (Purchasing Document):** This field is the primary key and uniquely identifies each purchase order. It references the `EBELN` field in the `EKPO` table.

- **EBELP (Purchasing Document Item):** This field, along with `EBELN`, forms the composite primary key. It references the `EBELP` field in the `EKPO` table.

- **MATNR (Material Number):** This field represents the material number associated with the purchase order item. It references the `MATNR` field in the `EKPO` table.

- **TXZ01 (Material Description/Short Text):** This field provides a short description of the material. It references the `TXZ01` field in the `EKPO` table.

- **LIFNR (Vendor):** This field represents the vendor associated with the purchase order. It references the `LIFNR` field in the `EKKO` table.

- **NAME1 (Vendor Name):** This field provides the name of the vendor. It references the `NAME1` field in the `LFA1` table.

- **BEDAT (Document Date):** This field indicates the date on which the purchase order was created. It references the `BEDAT` field in the `EKKO` table.

- **BSART (Document Type):** This field specifies the type of purchasing document. It references the `BSART` field in the `EKKO` table.

- **MENGE (PO Quantity):** This field represents the quantity ordered in the purchase order. It references the `MENGE` field in the `EKPO` table.

- **MEINS (Order Unit):** This field indicates the unit of measure for the ordered quantity. It references the `MEINS` field in the `EKPO` table.

- **NETPR (Net Price):** This field represents the net price per unit for the purchase order item. It references the `NETPR` field in the `EKPO` table.

- **NETWR (Net Value):** This field indicates the total net value of the purchase order item. It references the `NETWR` field in the `EKPO` table.

- **WEMNG (Quantity Delivered):** This field shows the quantity that has been delivered so far. It references the `WEMNG` field in the `EKET` table.

- **TO_BE_DELIVERED (To Be Delivered):** This calculated field represents the difference between the ordered quantity and the delivered quantity (PO Qty - Delivered Qty).

- **ELIKZ (Delivery Completed Indicator):** This field indicates whether the delivery for the purchase order item is complete. It references the `ELIKZ` field in the `EKPO` table and is used to mark POs as closed when set to 'X'.

The table is designed to facilitate the reporting and management of open purchase orders, allowing users to filter, sort, and close multiple POs efficiently.
