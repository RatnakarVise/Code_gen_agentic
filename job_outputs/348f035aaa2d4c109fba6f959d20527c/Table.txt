### 2) PURPOSE Section

**PURPOSE:**

The custom transparent table `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` is designed to store audit log entries for the closure of Purchase Orders (POs) in the SAP MM module. This table serves as a traceability mechanism, allowing users to track which POs have been closed, by whom, and when. The table fields and their relationships are as follows:

- **MANDT (Client):** This field represents the client in which the PO closure operation is executed. It is a standard field in SAP tables to ensure client-specific data storage.

- **EBELN (Purchase Order Number):** This field stores the unique identifier for the purchase order that has been closed. It references the purchase order number from the EKKO table, which is the Purchasing Document Header table.

- **EBELP (Item Number):** This field indicates the specific item within the purchase order that has been closed. It references the item number from the EKPO table, which is the Purchasing Document Item table.

- **ERNAM (User who executed closure):** This field captures the username of the individual who performed the PO closure operation. It is essential for audit purposes to identify the responsible user.

- **ERDAT (Date of closure):** This field records the date on which the PO closure was executed. It helps in tracking the timeline of closure activities.

- **ERZET (Time of closure):** This field logs the exact time when the PO closure was performed, providing a precise timestamp for the operation.

- **STATUS (Closure Status):** This field indicates the result of the closure operation, where 'S' represents a successful closure and 'F' indicates a failure. This status helps in quickly identifying the outcome of the closure process.

- **MESSAGE (Status Message):** This field contains any additional information or error messages related to the closure operation. It is useful for debugging and understanding the context of any issues encountered during the closure process.

The `ZPO_CLOSE_LOG` table is integral to the report program `ZMM_CLOSE_OPEN_PO`, which automates the closure of open POs. It ensures that all closure activities are logged systematically, providing a reliable audit trail for business users and auditors.
